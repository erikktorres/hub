Central storage for Tidepool planning and issue tracking.

This repository exists to provide a central place where we can put public items related to planning and execution of Tidepool projects. We do this because trying to manage a couple of dozen repositories individually will get a little bit too crazy.

We expect the issues in this repository to be pretty active, but they may be rather high level. If a high level task gets created in this repository, we can create a list of sub-issues in individual project repositories that need to be completed to close it.

If you identify an issue within any part of a Tidepool system and you don't know where to file it, please file it here, and we'll triage it into the right place.
